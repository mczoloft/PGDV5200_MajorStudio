In 1515, he created his woodcut of a Rhinoceros which had arrived in Lisbon from a written description and sketch by another artist, without ever seeing the animal himself. An image of the Indian rhinoceros, the image has such force that it remains one of his best-known and was still used in some German school science text-books as late as last century.[6] In the years leading to 1520 he produced a wide range of works, including the woodblocks for the first western printed star charts in 1515[15] and portraits in tempera on linen in 1516.
