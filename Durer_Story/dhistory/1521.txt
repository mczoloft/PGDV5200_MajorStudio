Dürer returned home in July 1521. He had an unknown illness which stayed with him for the rest of his life, and slowed his rate of work.[3]
Having secured his pension, Dürer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness—perhaps malaria[19]—which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.[6]
On his return to Nuremberg, Dürer worked on a number of grand projects with religious themes, including a crucifixion scene and a Sacra Conversazione, though neither was completed.[20] This may have been due in part to his declining health, but perhaps also because of the time he gave to the preparation of his theoretical works on geometry and perspective, the proportions of men and horses, and fortification.
